## **Our Work**

Our work aims to contribute to the integral development of the community by implementing different projects. We cover transversal areas like health, education, nutrition, sports, water and sanitation, gender, and resilience.

We execute our projects through strategic alliances and with the support of the community because we attempt to make our activities sustainable.

According to the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report, in 2018, 29.7 million people live in Mozambique. Of the total population, 62.9% lives below the income poverty line, living with less than USD 1.90 per day.

Besides, according to the World Food Programme, one-third of the population is chronically food insecure and half a million children aged 6-23 months are undernourished.

Under these circumstances, our projects intend to comprehensively address the essential subjects needed to develop a dignified life, before-mentioned as health, education, gender equality, water, and sanitation.
